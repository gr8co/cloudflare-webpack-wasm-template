# Cloudflare Webpack WASM template

- Open with VSCode using the .devcontainer for the fastest way to start programming
- run `wrangler preview` (optionally, provide your CF_ACCOUNT_ID in ENV or account_id in wrangler.toml)

This project template showcases how you can call javascript function within wasm, and how to
use Cloudflare workers using WASM using webpack.

Use as a wrangler template:
`wrangler generate $NAME https://github.com/ronaldslc/cloudflare-webpack-wasm-template`
